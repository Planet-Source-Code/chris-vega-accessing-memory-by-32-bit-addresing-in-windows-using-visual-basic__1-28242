## Accessing Memory by 32\-bit Addresing in Windows using Visual Basic


</div>

### Description

When we talk about *real* Pointer and Memory Addressing, most of us thinks of

Visual Basic limitations, ie, VB cannot access memory because VB has no pointer

datatype for a variable declarations. This confusion grow even larger when

a scenarios needed one *address* of a variable instead of its value, ie, from

where in memory was that variable located into a virtual space of currently

running process or a process or dynamic library. Well, forget those myths and read this Article to show you the inner light of Visual Basic Pointers.
